### âœ… Project Architecture & Key Decisions

---

#### **Architecture Decision: Monolith**

**Why Monolith over Microservices?**
- **Simplicity** â€“ Easier to develop, test, and deploy.
- **Performance** â€“ No inter-service network latency.
- **Consistency** â€“ Supports ACID transactions across operations.
- **Team Size** â€“ Ideal for small to medium-sized teams.
- **Operational Overhead** â€“ Lower infrastructure and maintenance complexity.

### ðŸš€ Key Features

---

#### **Complete Backend Implementation**
- RESTful APIs for URL operations
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Click tracking and analytics
- QR code generation support

---

#### **Production-Ready Setup**
- Docker containerization for isolated environments
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- Flyway for managing database schema migrations
- Redis caching for high-speed performance
- Health checks and monitoring for reliability

---

#### **Security Features**
- Input validation at all levels
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting as a security measure
- HTTPS configuration for secure communication

---

#### **Performance Optimizations**

### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

1. Set up the project structure as outlined in the `README.md`
2. Implement the backend APIs to replace any frontend mock logic
3. Configure database schema and migrations via Flyway
4. Set up the Docker environment for seamless local development
5. Create and configure Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for deployment automation
